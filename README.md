# maritime-explore
shiny dashboard to explore maritime data

Access this app live at https://shining-thiloshon.shinyapps.io/MaritimeExplorer/

Note that instead of a dropdown to select ship type, I have added it as a vertical button nav. I understand this adds additional performance overhead but since its a simple app, I preferred an aesthetic app.
